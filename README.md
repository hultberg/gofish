A simple go fish game written in rust.

## How to play

You enter the card value you wish to request from the computer player. If the computer does not have that card, you draw one from the deck (go fish) or you get the card. The goal of the game is to have the most books (four of a kind). 

## TODO

* Ensure the standings dont change ordering when the score is tied.
* Sort player hand cards by face and value.
* Better status reporting to better indicate what has happend during the game.
